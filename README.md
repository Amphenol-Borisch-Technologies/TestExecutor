# TestExecutor
A simple demo functional test sequencer/test executive program for sibling project TestExecutive.
    
  Sibling project TestExecutive is the necessary companion to TestExecutor.
  
  TestExecutor lags TestExecutive development, and therefore may compile with errors.
  - It's periodically updated with features/fixes from the non-simple, non-demo functional test program driving TestExecutive's development, so stay tuned.
